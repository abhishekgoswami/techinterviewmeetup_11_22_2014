Project *Perception*
==================

This project will parse all the online/TV/Audio content related to a brand, then **classify** the perception of that **brand** as **good** or **bad**, and plot it over time period. It will also provide realtime perception changes for any particular brand. The information provided by this project will also give you details, about kind of bad opinion with the url location of that information.

The output of this project is a web-application, which will use information from popular search engines like google, yahoo or bing, to get access to **brand** related **HTML** and **source** of that i.e URL. It will store it with the content. Then a backend process will run over these content and classify the brand perception to either **good** or **bad**.
